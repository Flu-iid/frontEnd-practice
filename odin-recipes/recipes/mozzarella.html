    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup cool water, divided</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon liquid rennet</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons citric acid</li>
        <li>1 gallon raw milk</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol type="1">     
        <li>Combine 1/4 cup water and rennet in a small bowl; mix well.</li>
        <li>Combine remaining 1/2 cup water and citric acid in another small bowl; mix until dissolved.</li>
        <li>Pour milk into a large pot set over medium heat. Stir in water-citric acid mixture. Heat milk, stirring occasionally, until it registers 90 degrees F (32 degrees C) on an instant-read thermometer, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove milk from heat and stir in rennet mixture in a figure-8 motion for 30 seconds. Stir counterclockwise for 30 seconds to still the milk. Let stand, covered, until milk sets into curd, 5 to 10 minutes. Press edge of the curd gently with a palette knife or the back of a spoon to check for firmness.</li>
        <li>Slice vertically into the pot to cut curd into 3/4-inch cubes with a palette knife. Stir curds gently, but leave cubes mostly intact.</li>
        <li>Return pot to the heat; cook over medium heat, stirring curds gently, until temperature reaches 109 degrees F (43 degrees C), about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.</li>
        <li>Ladle curds into a colander set over a large bowl using a slotted spoon. Press curds gently to extract liquid whey. Pour drained whey back into the pot.</li>
        <li>Heat whey to 185 degrees F (85 degrees C), about 5 minutes. Wearing gloves, tear off a piece of curd and place on a slotted spoon. Dip curd into hot whey for 5 to 10 seconds. Stretch, fold, and knead the curd. Repeat until mozzarella is smooth and elastic. Knead in salt and form curd into a ball. Repeat dipping and kneading process with remaining curd.</li>
        <li>Allow mozzarella to cool. Wrap tightly in plastic wrap and transfer to the refrigerator.</li>
